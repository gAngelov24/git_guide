Once inside a new folder, run [ git init ] that way git can track the changes you make to your project

git log (Shows all the commits you have made and their tag)

git checkout <tag> (You can use git checkout in combination with git log to move around your different commits)

git checkout main (this command will take you to the latest commit within the main branch)
