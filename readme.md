### This is a guide that I made for myself to better understand git; however, if you somehow found yourself on this page, welcome!

Git Guide

**Getting Started\n**
For me, git was never really taught too well even though I am studying at a high ranked university, hence, I am making a document that basically summerizes the most important steps to setting up your git and github


`git init` (initialize a branch) initializing a branch can be thought of like creating a folder. Git will track all your changes and then 

`git config` --global init.defaultBranch <name> (configure the initial branch name)

Once inside a new folder, run [`git init`] that way git can track the changes you make to your project

`git log` (Shows all the commits you have made and their tag)

`git checkout <tag> `(You can use git checkout in combination with git log to move around your different commits)

`git checkout main` (this command will take you to the latest commit within the main branch)
